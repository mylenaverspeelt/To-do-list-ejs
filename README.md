## Step 1 - Dependencies

You will need:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [node](https://nodejs.org/) 

Please install them if you don't have them already.

## Step 2 - Clone the repository:

From the command line, clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mylenaverspeelt/To-do-list-ejs.git
```

## Step 3 - Run the app

Once the dependencies are installed (npm install), you can run the app:

```sh
cd to-do-list-ejs
node app.js
```

For praticity, I recommend you to use nodemon to run the app, but it is not mandatory.

Your browser should open up the running app, or you can access: http://localhost:3000/
